# Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step

Welcome to your week 4 assignment (part 1 of 2)! Previously you trained a 2-layer Neural Network with a single hidden layer. This week, you will build a deep neural network with as many layers as you want!

- In this notebook, you'll implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
- For the next assignment, you'll use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.

**By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:**

- Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
- Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
- Implement an easy-to-use neural network class


# Deep Neural Network for Image Classification: Application

By the time you complete this notebook, you will have finished the last programming assignment of Week 4, and also the last programming assignment of Course 1! Go you! 

To build your cat/not-a-cat classifier, you'll use the functions from the previous assignment to build a deep network. Hopefully, you'll see an improvement in accuracy over your previous logistic regression implementation.  

**After this assignment you will be able to:**

- Build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and apply it to supervised learning
