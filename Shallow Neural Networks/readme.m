# Planar data classification with one hidden layer

Welcome to your week 3 programming assignment! It's time to build your first neural network, which will have one hidden layer. Now, you'll notice a big difference between this model and the one you implemented previously using logistic regression.

By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

- Implement a 2-class classification neural network with a single hidden layer
- Use units with a non-linear activation function, such as tanh
- Compute the cross entropy loss
- Implement forward and backward propagation
