1)Python Basics with Numpy (optional assignment)
Welcome to your first assignment. This exercise gives you a brief introduction to Python. Even if you've used Python before, this will help familiarize you with the functions we'll need.

Instructions:

You will be using Python 3.
Avoid using for-loops and while-loops, unless you are explicitly told to do so.
After coding your function, run the cell right below it to check if your result is correct.
After this assignment you will:

Be able to use iPython Notebooks
Be able to use numpy functions and numpy matrix/vector operations
Understand the concept of "broadcasting"
Be able to vectorize code

2) Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset
Welcome to your first (required) programming assignment! You will build a logistic regression classifier to recognize cats. This assignment will step you through how to do this with a Neural Network mindset, and will also hone your intuitions about deep learning.

Instructions:

Do not use loops (for/while) in your code, unless the instructions explicitly ask you to do so.
Use np.dot(X,Y) to calculate dot products.
You will learn to:

Build the general architecture of a learning algorithm, including:
Initializing parameters
Calculating the cost function and its gradient
Using an optimization algorithm (gradient descent)
Gather all three functions above into a main model function, in the right order.
